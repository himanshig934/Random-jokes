# Random-jokes

This project is a Random Jokes Generator created using JavaScript. It fetches random jokes from a public jokes API and displays them dynamically on the webpage. The UI is designed using Tailwind CSS, making it fully responsive and visually clean. This project helped me understand API integration, async/await, and modern CSS styling.
